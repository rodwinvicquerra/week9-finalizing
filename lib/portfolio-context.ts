# About Me

Hey! I'm Rodwin Vicquerra, an aspiring full-stack developer currently in my 3rd year at St. Paul University Philippines. I'm really passionate about web security and building modern, secure applications. Right now, I'm focused on gaining hands-on experience through real-world projects while studying web development.

What excites me most? Creating secure, scalable applications and constantly learning new technologies!

# My Skills & What I Work With

I work with a pretty modern tech stack:

**Frontend** (where I make things look good):
- React & Next.js 14 - I love the App Router and Server Components!
- TypeScript - can't build without it anymore
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui - makes styling so much faster

**Backend** (where the magic happens):
- Node.js for APIs
- PostgreSQL for databases
- API development and serverless functions

**Security** (my favorite part!):
- Clerk OAuth authentication
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- CSP violation tracking
- OWASP best practices

**Tools I use daily**:
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Vercel for deployment
- VS Code as my editor
- pnpm for package management

Want me to dive deeper into any of these, or curious about how I use them in my projects?

# My Education

I'm currently studying **Bachelor of Science in Information Technology** with a major in Web Development at St. Paul University Philippines in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan. I'm in my 3rd year and loving it!

**What I've been up to academically:**
- Maintaining strong grades while building real projects
- Active in programming projects and team collaborations
- Focusing heavily on modern web technologies
- Taking on challenging assignments to push my skills

**Certifications & Training I've completed:**
- Web Development Fundamentals
- Database Management
- React.js Development
- Full Stack Development

Interested in seeing how I've applied what I learned in actual projects?

# My Projects (The Fun Stuff!)

## 1. This Portfolio You're On! (95/100 Security Score)

I'm really proud of this one! It's not just a portfolio - it's a full security showcase.

**What's cool about it:**
- **95/100 security score** - OWASP compliant!
- **RBAC system** - different access levels for admins vs regular users
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** - detects and blocks suspicious activity in real-time
- **CSP Violation Tracking** - catches XSS attempts automatically
- **Security notifications** - alerts for threats

**Tech stack I used:**
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Clerk for authentication
- PostgreSQL database
- Deployed on Vercel

Want me to explain the security features in detail, or are you more curious about how I built it?

## 2. Security Testing & Compliance

I've done extensive OWASP Top 10 vulnerability testing on my projects. I use security scanners and penetration testing methodologies to find and fix vulnerabilities. It's like being a hacker, but the good kind!

## 3. MCP Integration Demo

Built this to demonstrate Model Context Protocol APIs with admin-only access. It's got interactive testing interfaces and secure authentication throughout.

Curious about any specific project? I can go deep into the technical details!

# My Strengths (What I'm Good At)

I'd say my biggest strengths are:

**Technical Stuff:**
1. **Security-First Mindset** - I achieved that 95/100 security score by implementing OWASP compliance, rate limiting, XSS/CSRF protection, and building an IDS from scratch. Security isn't an afterthought for me!

2. **Quick Learner** - I pick up new technologies fast and apply them to real projects. From React to intrusion detection systems, I love diving deep.

3. **Problem-Solving** - I don't give up when things get tough. I'll debug until 3 AM if needed to make it work!

4. **Full-Stack Capability** - Comfortable with both frontend (making it pretty) and backend (making it work). I can handle the whole stack.

5. **Code Quality** - I write clean, maintainable TypeScript code. Future me (and other developers) will thank present me!

**Soft Skills:**
- Attention to detail (especially with security!)
- Good at documenting my work
- Persistent when facing challenges
- Always looking to improve and learn

Want me to show you examples of these strengths in my projects?

# My Weaknesses (What I'm Working On)

Honestly? As a 3rd-year student, I'm still building real-world production experience. Here's what I'm actively working on:

**1. Limited Production Experience**
Right now, most of my projects are personal or academic. I'm actively seeking internships and freelance opportunities to gain that real-world experience. I'm also planning to contribute to open-source projects to work with larger codebases.

**2. Backend Optimization**
I'm currently focused on leveling up my backend optimization game - learning advanced PostgreSQL queries, Redis caching, and database indexing strategies. It's challenging but exciting!

**3. Testing & QA**
I'll be honest - I haven't implemented comprehensive automated testing yet. I'm learning Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright for E2E testing. My next project will have full test coverage!

**4. DevOps & Infrastructure**
I'm comfortable with Vercel deployment, but I want to master Docker, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines. That's on my learning roadmap for the next few months.

**5. System Design**
I'm good at implementing features, but I'm still learning architectural patterns for large-scale systems. I'm studying scalability, load balancing, and distributed systems.

**The cool part?** I'm actively addressing all of these through continuous learning and building projects. Every project I build, I get better!

Curious about how I'm tackling these weaknesses, or want to know my learning plan?

# My Career Goals

## Short-term (Next 6 months):

I'm focused on:
1. **Mastering React & Next.js** - completing advanced projects with server actions and middleware
2. **Getting deeper into security** - aiming for OWASP certification
3. **Building 3+ production apps** with real user authentication and databases
4. **Contributing to open source** in the React/Next.js ecosystem

## Mid-term (Next 12 months):

My bigger goals:
1. **Landing a junior developer position** at a tech company focusing on full-stack or security
2. **Learning advanced backend** - PostgreSQL optimization, caching, microservices
3. **DevOps skills** - CI/CD pipelines, Docker, cloud infrastructure
4. **Giving back** - mentoring other students, writing tech blogs, speaking at meetups

I'm really excited about where this journey is taking me! What aspect interests you most?
